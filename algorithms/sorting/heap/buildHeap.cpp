//Build Max Heap is a techique for building a heap in which 
//the root is the maximum and the internal nodes are greater than left or right
//In Heap THe leaves are from from (n/2) + 1 to n
//and internal nodes are from 1 to n/2
//max heapify works from root and compares left and right
//if left is bigger then replace it with root and do max heapify on left side
//if right is bigger than do max heapify on right
