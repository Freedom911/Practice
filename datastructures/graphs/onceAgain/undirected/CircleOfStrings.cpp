 * This problem is very good 
 *
 * Given an array of strings, find if the given strings can be chained to 
 * form a circle. A string X can be put before another string Y in circle 
 * if the last character of X is same as first character of Y.
 *
 * Examples: 
 * Input: arr[] = {"geek", "king"}
 * Output: Yes, the given strings can be chained.
 *
 * Note that the last character of first string is same
 * as first character of second string and vice versa is
 * also true.
 * Input : arr[] = [“ijk”, “kji”, “abc”, “cba”]
 * Output : No
