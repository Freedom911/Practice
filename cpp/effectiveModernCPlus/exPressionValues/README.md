we need a name for something in memory. There are two properties
1. Identity - We have name for ,we can create pointer to and reference of.
2. Movable - we can move the values
we have following things
1. glvalue - Generalized lvalue which is equal to lvalue + xvalue. It has identity
2. lvalue - lvalue refers to the memory location. it has identity but cant be moved
3. xvalue - exPiring value it is kind of glvalue but also rvalue. It has identity and can be moved.
4. prvalue - pure rvalue. It has no identity and can be moved
5. rvalue - is equal to prvalue + xvalue. It can be moved.
